// If your reading this looking for frameworks my portfolio was made from scratch using raw js / httml / css. 

// -- 2024-09-21 heavily updated portfolio to use dynamically generated content and hash navigation in order to 
slightly reduce load times and visible loading (was a 0.2s delay but still) also made use of caching for a totally seamless expierence. Also reduced size of all images to help with load times as when I made it I was a little lazy and was just using 1440 images even if it was only a square being shown.

// -- 2025-04-13 added 3 new projects.

// Didnt really need to use any html markup frameworks or react as all the components are static.
