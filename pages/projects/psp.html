        <h1>Partner Success Portal - CO-OP Project</h1>
    
        <p>In the summer of 2023, during my CO-OP at a small to medium-sized ISP, I built a Partner Success Portal for the staff and inner team. I worked on it independently, regularly updating the senior engineer on my progress. Due to security and privacy concerns, I cannot share images or examples as it's an internal tool for the staff team containing sensitive data.</p>
    
        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Integrated and hosted on Azure.</li>
            <li>Fully integrated OAuth authentication, limiting access to users with specific permissions.</li>
            <li>Integration with multiple APIs including Microsoft Graph, ConnectWise, Datto API, Meraki, and Umbrella.</li>
            <li>Quality of life features including settings, responsiveness, dark and light mode based on browser preference, and the ability to save and download data to CSV.</li>
            <li>Management and viewing of data and key information from different tenants, each with thousands of users.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Examples of some pages and information include user email storage, licenses, security settings like MFA, OneDrive storage, security scores, and a ticket manager for support, among others.</p>
    
        <p>Ability to quickly view key data by multiple sorting methods implemented, including search or clicking headers to reverse sorting order. Headers set to multiple templates based on the data and presentation. For example, sorting by true or false or by price.</p>
    
        <p>Full documentation written for easier addition of more content.</p>
    
        <p>Frontend made with Microsoft's C# Blazor framework and Fluent UI, featuring a sleek minimalist design. It remains a key tool for the team and is still in use as of 2024. Backend hosted on Azure.</p>
    
        <p>Overall, I had a great time working on this project and learned nearly everything about full-stack development. Thanks to this project, my school's web development class was a total breeze. This is one of the most satisfying things I've made as it still gets used today and is an actual useful tool, unlike most of my other projects.</p>
