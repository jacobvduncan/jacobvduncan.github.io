        <h1>Personal Photo Social Media Application</h1>
    
        <p>During my first semester of the second year, I built a personal photo social media application using Express for the backend and raw HTML, JS, and CSS for the frontend. Despite the scale of the project, I opted not to use a frontend framework to challenge myself. The original plan was to use React, but as it was a school assignment, I aimed to minimize the use of frameworks.</p>
    
        <p>I created functions to generate inner HTML strings and dynamically update specific elements based on what needed to be shown or updated. The UI and styles experimented during this project influenced my current portfolio's design, resulting in a sleek minimalist look that I was pleased with. I met all assignment expectations and received full marks.</p>
    
        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Backend uses Express and MongoDB for the database.</li>
            <li>Users can post photos, follow other users, view all interactions, and like photos.</li>
            <li>Simple authentication system checking for accounts using username-password pairs (for assignment ease, in a real-world scenario, OAuth would be used).</li>
            <li>Clean UI with successful interactions visible without refresh.</li>
            <li>Host workshops and quickly search for different artworks using Mongoose queries.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>It's important to note that this was an educational project and was never released or intended to be.
