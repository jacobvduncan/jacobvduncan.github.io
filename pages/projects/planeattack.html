        <h1>Two Dimensional OpenGL Project - Winter 2024</h1>

        <p>Below is a project called plane attack that was developed continuously over the course of the winter for one of my course's final projects. It was made in C++ and OpenGL with no other external libraries. Below are some of the features this project has:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Movement transformations done with both parametric and physically based equations.</li>
        
            <li>Multiple different enemy types with different looks, statistics, and behaviors.</li>
        
            <li>Multiple different weapon types the player and AI can use.</li>
        
            <li>A set of collectible items that give power-ups or affect player statistics, all reflected visually.</li>
        
            <li>Custom-built UI to reflect time and other stats using hierarchical transformations of the player and different render passes.</li>
        
            <li>Simple 2D collision detection using both circle-to-circle and ray-to-circle depending on the object.</li>

            <li>Different particle and shader effects such as bloom, grayscale, and particles for bullet trails and explosions.</li>
        </ul>
