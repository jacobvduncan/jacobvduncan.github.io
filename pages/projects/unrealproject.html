        <h1>Unnamed Unreal Project - Summer 2022</h1>

        <p>
            An unnamed project I started in the summer of 2022. Created a working vehicle and full character movement logic and animations. Also created a pretty good fox AI. I was thinking of creating a game in which you get into a car accident and then have to survive or something but I started it late in the summer and then had to start preparing for my first year at University so I dropped it. In this project none of the models are my own, I only rigged and animated the character model myself. I also created a little bit of a build system and some interactable deployables.
