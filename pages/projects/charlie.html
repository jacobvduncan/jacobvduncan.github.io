        <h1>Charlie Charlie Challenge - A Multiplayer Co-op Horror Game</h1>
    
        <p>Charlie Charlie Challenge is a game I made during the winter semester of my second year, its a multiplayer co-op horror game based off the childs game. This is my best game ive made and the most polish has gone into this one. After release I later found one twitch streamer played it for three hours straight until he beat it and I was very happy with this result. </p>
    
        <p>I highly suggest you give this one a try, especially if you are looking at my portfolio for a game dev position. This shows my best work and you can contact me and ask for a free key. The whole thing was done solo and many of the models were also made by myself and 100% of the code was written by me.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fully replicated multiplayer inventory system implemented using C++. Implements drop items and different interactions with multiple items. Applies standard OOP concepts like abstraction and inheritance for a clean and concise codebase.</li>
    
            <li>Full downed system and revive system.</li>
    
            <li>Server browser and a full settings menu.</li>
    
            <li>Dynamic AI that adapts to any number of players gets harder and harder as game goes on.</li>
    
            <li>Advanced replicated items, such as a board that detects specific voip phrases, a EMF reader.</li>
    
            <li>Full in game guide and pre lobby guide.</li>
    
            <li>Dyanimc gameplay, game is different everytime you play which is why this is by far the best game ive done as its actually fun for me as well. I dont really know where things will spawn or what he will be doing.</li>

            <li>Emphasis on UI and slightly guiding player</li>

            <li>Advanced post FX including fisheye, DOF, physics based vignette</li>

            <li>Heavy attention to sound and game design.</li>

            <li>Steam achievements and keeping track of in game stats so player knows how game went.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>This is my best game dev project and took a good amount of time. Everything if fully replicated and I spent a good amount of time on polishing / bug fixing. I highly suggest you try it yourself or even try it with me to see my full skills. Full gameplay and trailers can be found on my youtube.</p>
