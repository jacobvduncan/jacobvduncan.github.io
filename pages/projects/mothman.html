        <h1>Mothman - A Multiplayer Co-op Horror Game</h1>
    
        <p>Mothman is a game I made during the first couple of months of my second year in university. It is a multiplayer co-op horror game where the player's objective is to hunt down a creature called Mothman and eliminate it. The game features fully replicated gameplay, and all assets were created by myself, including environmental megascans for rocks and trees and metahumans for the characters. I also re-rigged, animated, retextured, and customized the metahumans. The game was developed solo, and here are some key features:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Fully replicated multiplayer inventory system implemented using C++. Implements drop items and different interactions with multiple items. Applies standard OOP concepts like abstraction and inheritance for a clean and concise codebase.</li>
    
            <li>Full weapon and projectile system with reload animations, accurate barrel loading, and ammo/chamber count.</li>
    
            <li>Server browser and a full settings menu. In-game UI using an in-game monitor to improve immersion.</li>
    
            <li>Dynamic AI that adapts to any number of players with different states and actions.</li>
    
            <li>In-game replicated character selection, saving character preferences per session.</li>
    
            <li>Various items including bear traps, weapons, scopes, flashlights, bait, and more.</li>
    
            <li>Full settings menu allowing gameplay in extreme fidelity on high-end PCs or lower graphics for lower-end computers.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>There were numerous quality-of-life additions and a focus on the user experience in this project. I dedicated time to ensure an excellent movement system and stamina system, and refined the animations for a smooth experience. Despite being one of my most significant projects, I feel like I learned the least from it. It felt more like applying my existing knowledge without exploring new approaches. While I might approach some aspects differently, I am satisfied with this project as it showcases some of my skills.</p>
