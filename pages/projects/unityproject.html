        <h1>Unnamed Unity Project - Fall 2022</h1>

        <p>This is an unnamed Unity project I worked on during the fall of 2022 when first starting University on my Mac. I didn't get far and spent most of the time exploring Unity's new official multiplayer framework, now known as Netcode for GameObjects. My focus was on rigging a character, implementing full movement including crouching and running, and ensuring proper smooth and replicated animations. I successfully achieved these goals, but beyond making some trees work, the project was primarily an exploration in Unity as I transitioned from Unreal. Lacking specific ideas, I eventually dropped the project. Below are some old images I found.</p>
