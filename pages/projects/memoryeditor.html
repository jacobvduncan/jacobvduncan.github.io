    <h1>Godot 3D RTS - March 2025</h1>

    <p>Created a simple clean application for finding, and editing a processes memory while its running, an demonstration of the program in action can be found <a onclick="openNewTab('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJtuTwpZR1c')" style="color: white; cursor: pointer; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Built a live memory debugger in C++ capable of scanning and modifying values in real-time while a target program is running.</li>
        <li>Used Qt framework to build a responsive and modular GUI, allowing for easy scalability and future feature additions.</li>
        <li>Implemented memory scanning algorithms to detect value patterns and locate addresses with minimal performance impact.</li>
        <li>Supported value freezing and editing, enabling users to lock specific memory values and force changes during runtime.</li>
        <li>Integrated pointer following and offset tracing for handling dynamic memory and more complex memory structures.</li>
        <li>Added process selection and access controls, allowing the tool to attach to and monitor multiple processes securely.</li>
        <li>Organized the codebase around Qtâ€™s signal-slot system to keep UI updates in sync with backend memory operations in real time.</li>
    </ul>
