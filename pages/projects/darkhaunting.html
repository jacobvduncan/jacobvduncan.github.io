        <h1>Dark Haunting - Multiplayer Co-op Horror Game</h1>
    
        <p>Dark Haunting is the first game I ever made and the first game I ever released. It was made using UE5EA and was also one of the first games ever released using UE5. It's a multiplayer co-op horror game based on the folklore Slenderman. Essentially, it's multiplayer Slenderman, and its mechanics are not very complex. Everything is replicated, and there is, of course, a server browser. The goal is to collect eight pages to win, with a half dynamic AI designed to deal with up to four players. The game features flashlights and some simple blended animations. I only understood what an array was maybe halfway through the project. I had zero prior experience in any programming or logic before this project. Although it's arguably poor compared to my other projects, I did learn the most from this project. Looking back, I've improved so much and am still proud of it being the first thing I've done. Had it just been single player, it would have been magnitudes easier for me to make, especially with my limited knowledge at the time.</p>
    
        <p>The game is generally quite bad but this is actually one of the ones im most proud of. We all have to start somewhere and I was only 15 when I started working on this and didnt even know what an array was until halfway through. Had I not completed this I might not of even gone in CS.</p>

        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>A server browser, settings menu, and basic UI.</li>
            <li>Full game loop, AI, and goal for players.</li>
            <li>Basic animations, replicated head flashlight, and simple character selection.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Overall, the game isn't too complex and is actually pretty funny with friends. Maybe one day I will remake this later in the future as, of course, with my knowledge now, I could do a significantly better job, and it would be a neat comparison.</p>
