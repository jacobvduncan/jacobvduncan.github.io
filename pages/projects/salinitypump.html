    <h1>RTOS Salinity Pump - April 2025</h1>

    <p>For a fourth year operating systems class me and 2 other's loaded QNX, a proprietary blackberry RTOS onto a RPI to dynamically control the salinity levels in a solution/container (in our case just a jar).</p>

    <p>Used two pumps, one to pump in freshwater, another to pump in saltwater.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Built a real-time salinity control system using QNX on Raspberry Pi, adjusting solution levels with two pumps based on live sensor readings.</li>
        <li>Created a web interface with Node.js and Express.js to view and update salinity values, hosted on an Amazon EC2 server.</li>
        <li>Set up reliable two-way communication between the Raspberry Pi and web server using periodic cURL GET and POST requests.</li>
        <li>Configured QNX RTOS on the Raspberry Pi with working WiFi, networking, and GPIO control for pumps and sensors.</li>
        <li>Connected and calibrated a TDS sensor with an ADC over I2C, integrating it into the system for accurate salinity measurement.</li>
        <li>Handled full hardware setup, including pump control via relays, power supply wiring, and soldering stable connections to the Pi.</li>
        <li>Managed real-time timing and logic in C to ensure responsive and accurate system behavior under a real-time operating system.</li>
    </ul>
