        <h1>Floating Coffin - A First Person Survival Game</h1>
    
        <p>Floating Coffin is the only game I've released using Unity. I actually made this game solely on my MacBook during the first year of university as I did not bring my computer to school that year. For some reason, I really wanted to make a game from scratch on my Mac and on an Apple product, and I did that. Every asset in this game was modeled and textured by myself. It is a first-person survival game inspired by other sandbox survival games like Subnautica. It contains a full pressure system, multiple stats like oxygen, heat, water, etc. Full space movement and ship movement. The idea for this game was inspired by a clip of Interstellar, and I wanted to recreate that feeling. I'm actually quite impressed with how this project turned out, as I managed to recreate that exact feeling for myself. The actual game design is somewhat lacking as it's quite boring; however, the mechanics were excellently implemented. It contains a full crafting and inventory system similar to other games.</p>
    
        <p>The most difficult part of this project was actually having a character walk with normal gravity on a rotating floating rigidbody. I managed to do this by basically simulating the walking on another fake spaceship and then just replicate the transform of the player to the outside ship. It also contains a full building system and while on a rotating ship, which was harder than it sounds as this is a rigidbody I'm building on. I learned a lot from this project and it engraved the relation between child and parent transforms and also made me understand how important update vs late update is in Unity.</p>
    
        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Full building system and interacting with deployables and picking them back up.</li>
            <li>Full space movement along every axis possible, including rotational torque.</li>
            <li>Complicated statistical systems including basics like food health etc., and also pressure, oxygen, temperature based on leaks.</li>
            <li>Full farming system including progressive plant growth until harvestable, fertilization, and watering required for full growth.</li>
            <li>Text to morse code audio device, fully realistic and accurate.</li>
            <li>Black hole gravity and visuals, making a player walk on a floating rotating rigidbody by keeping track of two scenes, an inner scene and outer scene.</li>
            <li>Full game loop settings menu and standard UI.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I actually had much bigger plans for this project; however, it was taking too long as a solo developer, so I just pretty much finished what I had and dropped it as I was going into my second year of school and wanted to start something fresh then. I still really like the idea and it seems like a good single-player game if I had more ideas with what to do with gameplay; however, unfortunately, I probably won't go back to it.</p>
