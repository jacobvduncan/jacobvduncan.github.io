        In my freetime when im not doing school my work or game devlopment I enjoy airsoft, and scuba diving. I have been playing video games and using technology long before I remember. This portfolio will be updated every time I complete something of significance. Of course there are many self projects and school assignments I have completed however this portfolio only contains my biggest achievements. It was last updated on 2024-09-21.
